# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Safe Nasher

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about making something out of javascript. The purpose of this blog is to show my progress in making my project.

## Content
For my project, I am making a platformer game where one of us is the main character and one of us is the enemy. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying kaboom in order to make my platformer game.

## Implications
my game connects people and they have fun together. It helps people relieve boredom. it connects people from all around the world from different cultures. Games have negative impact on the environment because it is estimated that 24 million metric tons of carbon emissions is made by games. But games also create jobs for people. It gain 74 billon revenue.
