I chose kaboom for the tool I will learn for the whole year for my freedom project. Kaboom was my backup tool, after I tried to work with melon the documention for [melon](https://melonjs.org) was confusing. I had to download 2 things for it to work I guess? I didn't want to do that so my backup was kaboom. I still wanted to make a game. I also remember that a lot of people did kaboom last year so I can get a lot of help. I started to read kabooms [documentation](https://kaboomjs.com) it was easier to understand than melon is. its hard to understand but at least its readable. The skills I got better at was reading documentation and Embracing failure. I Embraced failure by trying to work with kaboom and trying to understand what it does. In the EDP Im still in the defining the problem.
