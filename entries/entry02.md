I tinkered with my tool a lot withen this past weeks. I followed this [github](https://github.com/replit/kaboom) and I followed the "Start a Project With create-kaboom" I did it and then I started to code a little tried to add movements and platforms and it worked! After I did that the next week I asked Mr. Mueller if it ok to use this way of making my game. He said I should follow the cdn way. Now I gotta recode my game with the cdn way and not the way I followed.
