These past few weeks has been hard for me because I was doing pretty good with my FP(freedom project). But then my whole IDE just got wiped out and all of my files got deleted. My SEP project and hw were saved because they were on github, but not my FP so then I had to restarted. I had some code because of my and Jadien talking to eachother on how we want the project to be but not much. So I just copy pasted that code and I got this. (copy and paste the error here). I was confused when I got this because this never happened before. If I had an error it would pop up in the console but doesnt turn my screen blue. I thought maybe I wrote it wrong and went to the [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) website and saw that they used the same ``gravity()`` syntax and I spent maybe over an hour thinking whats wrong I removed the``gravity`` and added some other code and the same thing happened where I cound't add my code in without the blue error screen popping up. Then I read something on the top of the website and it said it updated. So all that for nothing, but it is what it is and I went to the updated kaboom and relearn some stuff. So ``gravity()`` turned into ``setGravity()``. Most of the code still works so I don't have to change much.
